Initially, please go to the test.php file and you need to specify the path where the libraries of python are located and also make sure to put the dataset in the same folder

Click on the webpage.html and open on a browser
Enter you field on departure airport from the drop down menu and same as for arrival airport.
Enter your time and click on submit this will take you to the results page.

Before you do that, make sure you have a python install on your system with libraries such numpy, matplotlib 
and scikit learn. Because, these are the key elements to run the decision tree. 

When you navigate to the results page you will be getting the output based on the decision tree. 
And the probability of the delay will be based on the naive Bayes theorem on the input.

Contributions towards Implementation:
Aradhya:
Designed the UI web page. 
Implemented the Naive Bayes to determine the probability of the delays in Python.

Shashank:
Data Cleaning and Preparation from massive data set of 264,000 entries.
Relevant data generation to run the classifier in JAVA.
Data Extraction on PHP.

Siddesh:
Implemented the decision tree classifier using scikitlearn libraries in Python. 
Prediction algorithm based on the results of the decision tree algorithm.
Associating all the python scripts to PHP page.
